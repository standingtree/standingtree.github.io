		<li>I'm a strategic finance professional with a passion for financial modeling, programming, and over a decade of experience in corporate finance (M&A and capital markets) and private credit investing</li>
		<li>Currently part of the management team of a private equity-backed energy company (oil and gas)</li>
		<li>In my current role, I specialize in building custom programs that connect operational inputs (cost and activity scheduling) to market data (for commodity prices, equities, and bonds)</li>
		<li>These models (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta">perpetual beta</a>) aim to provide a holistic, granular, and ultimately robust, view of a company's ability to manage its cash flow and leverage (debt load), as well as help management understand financial positioning relative to the broader market</li>
		<li>Over the years, my interest in programming financial decision tools has led me to seek out a deeper technical skillset, which currently encompasses advanced Excel (using data connections and VBA), Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly, etc), JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
		<li>In 2021, my interdisciplinary explorations led me to the <a href="https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding">MITxPro Full Stack Web Development course</a>, which has been extremely rewarding from a learning perspective. I hope to use these skills to augment my models and build awesome websites, front-end to back-end</li>
		<li>This website started as the final project for the first module of the full stack course, and I will be updating it over time</li>
		<li>BA in Mathematical Economic Analysis from Rice University (2010)</li>
